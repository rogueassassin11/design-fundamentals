  WEB DESIGN RULES
  1. TYPOGRAPHY
    -> arranging type to make written language legible and readable
    -> Serif - traditional classic look / conveys trustworthiness / for long texts
    -> Sans-serif - modern / clean / simple
    -> Use only good typefaces: Sans-serif: (Inter, Open Sans, Roboto, Montserrat, Work Sans, Lato), Serif: (Merriweather, Aleo, Playfair, Cormorant, Cardo, Lora)
    -> Use only one or two typeface
    -> have a typescale system!

    FONTSIZE
    -> Choose the right typeface according to the website personality
    -> Font-size: normal text: between 16 - 32px;
    -> long text (blog post) - 20px+  
    -> headlines: 50px+, bold (600+)
    -> For any text, don't go below 400 font-weight
    
    READING EXPERIENCE
    -> use less than 75 characters per line
    -> normal line-height: 1.5 - 2; larger: below 1.5
    -> The smaller and longer the text, the larger the line height
    -> decrease letter spacing in headline
    -> Use caps on short titles, small and bold and decrease letter-spacing
    -> don't justify text
    -> don't center long text blocks

  2. COLORS
    -> choose the right color, it should match the website personality
    -> use a good color tone (Open color / tailwindcss / flat ui colors)
    -> you need two types: main color and a grey color; you may also add an accent color (palleton / coolors)
    -> create lighter (tint) and shades (darker) versions of the colors (tint and shade generator)
    -> use your main color to draw attention to the most important elements on the page
  
    COLORS AND TYPOGRAPHY
    -> on a dark colored backgrounds, use a tint of the background for text color
    -> text should not be completely black
    -> don't make text too light for accessibility; contrast ratio should be at least 4.5:1 for normal text, and 3:1 for large text (18px+)
  
  3. IMAGES
    -> you may use product photos, storytelling photos, illustrations and patterns
    -> use relevant images to support your website's message
    -> prefer original images, or original-looking stock images (unsplash / pexels / drawkit / undraw)
    -> to show real people to trigger user's emotions
    -> crop images to fit your message

    HANDLING TEXT ON IMAGES
    -> method 1: darken or brigthen the image (using a gradient)
    -> method 2: position text into a neutral image area
    -> method 3: put text in a box

    TECHNICAL DETAILS
    -> for high-res screens, make image dimensions 2x big
    -> compress images for a lower file size (squoosh)

  4. ICONS
    -> use a good icon pack (phosphor icons / ionicons / icons8)
    -> use only one icon pack and don't mix!
    -> use icon fonts (SVG / vector based)
    -> have to have similar roundness, weight and filled/outlined depending on the typography
    -> provides visual assistance to text
    -> used for product feature blocks
    -> associated with actions as labels
    -> icons can be used as bullet points

    HOW TO USE ICONS WELL
    -> to be neutral, use same color as text / more attention, use different color
    -> don't make icons larger than what they were designed for / if needed, enclose them on a shape

    5. SHADOWS
    -> creates depth (3D), the more shadow, the further away from the interface the element
    -> can be used on boxes and text
    -> less shadow: serious/elegant / more shadow: playful/fun
    -> use shadows in small doses; don't add shadows to every element
    -> go light on shadows and don't make them too dark!
    
    WHEN TO USE SHADOWS
    -> use small shadows for elements you want to draw attention to
    -> use medium shadows for larger areas
    -> use large shadows for elements that should really float
    -> experiment with changing shadows upon click and hover
    -> experiment with glows (colored shadows)

  6. BORDER RADIUS
    -> more border-radius: playful / less border-radius: serious
    -> match the roundness of the typeface
    -> can be used on buttons, images, icons, standout sections

  7. WHITESPACE
     -> the right amount makes designs clean, modern, and polished  
     -> use a ton of whitespace between sections
     -> use a lot also on between groups of elements
     -> inside groups of elements just use whitespace

     HOW MUCH WHITESPACE TO USE
     -> Law of proximity - the more elements belong together, the closer they should be
     -> Start with a lot of whitespace, then remove from there
     -> match other design choices, big texts and icons need more whitespace
     -> have a space typescale! Multiples of 16px would be great
  
  8. VISUAL HEIRARCHY
     -> Establishes which elements are the most important ones and draw attention to them
     -> defines a path for users to guide them through the page
     -> use a combination of position, size, color, spacing, borders, and shadows
     -> Position important elements closer to the top of the page
     -> images draw a lot of attention so use them mindfully
     -> use whitespace strategically
     
     VISUAL HEIRARCHY ON TEXT ELEMENTS
     -> use font-size, font-weight, color, and whitespace
     -> lighten text-color to de-emphasize
     -> emphasize titles, sub-titles, links, buttons, datapoints, icon
     
     VISUAL HEIRARCHY BETWEEN COMPONENTS
     -> emphasize an important component using background color, shadow, or border
     -> you can de-emphasize one component if beside another one
     -> emphasize testimonials, call-to-actions, highlights, preview cards, forms, pricing tables
  
  9. USER EXPERIENCE
     -> user interface - visual presentation of the product / what makes an interface beautiful
     -> UX - overall experience while using the product / what makes an interface is useful and functional
     -> UX design cannot exist without UI design
     -> the goal of UX design is to align the user's goals with the business' goals
     
     UX RULES FOR USABILITY
     -> use patterns that users know, familiarity with the layout is more important than being original
     -> make your call-to-action the most prominent
     -> use blue text and underlined text for only links!
     -> animations should have purpose and be fast (200 - 500ms)
     -> in forms, align label and fiends in a single vertical line
     -> offer users good feedback for all actions: form error/success
     -> place action buttons where they will create an effect (law of locality)
     
     UX RULES FOR WEBSITE CONTENT
     -> use a descriptive, keyword-focused headline / don't be vague!
     -> only include relevant information
     -> use simple words and avoid technical jargons
     -> break up long texts with sub-headings, bullet points, images, or block quotes
  
  10. WEBSITE PERSONALITY
      -> How do you want your website to appear to users? What vibe do you want to transmit?
      -> choose a personality and apply the personality trait ingredients

      1. Serious/Elegant -> thin serif, golden/pastel colors / for real estate, high fashion, or luxary products
      2. Minimalist -> small or medium boxy sans-serif / black text / only one color / for portfolios / minimalism companies / software startups
      3. Plain/neutral - sans-serif / safe colors (blue/black / used by well-established corporations
      4. Bold/confident -> boxy and bold sans-serif / digital agencies / software startups / travel / 'strong' companies
      5. Calm/peaceful -> soft serif / pastel colors / for healthcare / consumer well-being
      6. Startup/Upbeat -> medium sans-serif / light-grey background / blue, green, or purple / for software startups / modern-looking company
      7. Playful/fun -> colorful and round or handwritten sans-serif / for child, food, and animal products

  11. STEAL LIKE AN ARTIST
      -> do not completely copy, take the good parts and adapt them to your needs
      -> you can use sites like land-book / one page love / awwwards / screenlane

  12. ELEMENTS, COMPONENTS, AND LAYOUTS
      -> Elements -> Components -> Layout -> Webpage
      -> use common elements and components to convey website's info
      -> combine components into layouts using common layout patterns
  
  13. LAYOUT PATTERNS
