  WEB DESIGN RULES
  1. TYPOGRAPHY
    -> arranging type to make written language legible and readable
    -> Serif - traditional classic look / conveys trustworthiness / for long texts
    -> Sans-serif - modern / clean / simple
    -> Use only good typefaces: Sans-serif: (Inter, Open Sans, Roboto, Montserrat, Work Sans, Lato), Serif: (Merriweather, Aleo, Playfair, Cormorant, Cardo, Lora)
    -> Use only one or two typeface
    -> have a typescale system!

    FONTSIZE
    -> Choose the right typeface according to the website personality
    -> Font-size: normal text: between 16 - 32px;
    -> long text (blog post) - 20px+  
    -> headlines: 50px+, bold (600+)
    -> For any text, don't go below 400 font-weight
    
    READING EXPERIENCE
    -> use less than 75 characters per line
    -> normal line-height: 1.5 - 2; larger: below 1.5
    -> The smaller and longer the text, the larger the line height
    -> decrease letter spacing in headline
    -> Use caps on short titles, small and bold and decrease letter-spacing
    -> don't justify text
    -> don't center long text blocks

  2. COLORS
    -> choose the right color, it should match the website personality
    -> use a good color tone (Open color / tailwindcss / flat ui colors)
    -> you need two types: main color and a grey color; you may also add an accent color (palleton / coolors)
    -> create lighter (tint) and shades (darker) versions of the colors (tint and shade generator)
    -> use your main color to draw attention to the most important elements on the page
  
    COLORS AND TYPOGRAPHY
    -> on a dark colored backgrounds, use a tint of the background for text color
    -> text should not be completely black
    -> don't make text too light for accessibility; contrast ratio should be at least 4.5:1 for normal text, and 3:1 for large text (18px+)
  
  3. IMAGES
    -> you may use product photos, storytelling photos, illustrations and patterns
    -> use relevant images to support your website's message
    -> prefer original images, or original-looking stock images (unsplash / pexels / drawkit / undraw)
    -> to show real people to trigger user's emotions
    -> crop images to fit your message

    HANDLING TEXT ON IMAGES
    -> method 1: darken or brigthen the image (using a gradient)
    -> method 2: position text into a neutral image area
    -> method 3: put text in a box

    TECHNICAL DETAILS
    -> for high-res screens, make image dimensions 2x big
    -> compress images for a lower file size (squoosh)
